  "summary": "The diff implements Internet Identity authentication infrastructure for a job portal and business directory. All authentication-related features are present, including login/logout UI, authentication state management, protected routes, and actor configuration. However, the BuildRequest lacks structured requirements and acceptance criteria, making it difficult to verify completeness. No evidence of explicitly excluded non-goals (Aadhaar, SMS/OTP, phone-based auth) was found.",
